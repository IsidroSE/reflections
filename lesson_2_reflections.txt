1. What happens when you initialize a repository? 

	It creates a new .git folder.

Why do you need to do it?

	Because this is where is going to save
	all metadata of all commits of this
	repository.

2. How is the staging area different from the working 
directory and the repository? What value do you think 
it offers?

	The staging area is a temporally area where you
	add the files that you want to commit. The working
	directory is the actual directory that you can see
	when you see this repository in the explorer and
	the repository is all the git metadata saved from
	this directory, including all commits.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have 
one commit per logical change?

	You use the staging area to prepare all changes
	that you want to make in the same commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful 
in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

	Branches are helpful for situations like when you want
	to create a new mode of your game like an easier mode
	for begginners or when you want to implement your
	project with a second language, it's an option to
	create a new branch and do the changes there without
	changing the entire project.
