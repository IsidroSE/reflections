How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    You can compare your actual file and the same file from yesterday to see
    the differences, so you can know what lines were changed and where the
    bug is.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You will have several copies of your file, so you will always can go back
    to a point where the bug was originated and it also is a security option
    in case that you lose your file.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git was created for developers, others like Google Docs no.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    -git log -> it shows you all the commits that has been made since the
    project was first created.

    -git diff ID_1 ID_2 -> compares 2 commits, it shows how many lines were
    deleted and how many files were added to the file.
